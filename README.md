# My first ever react project with redux

it was super overkill, but i had to apply the concepts in a small project so I made this. I learned so much new things and became more familiar with redux and redux toolkit even though my code isn't the best since I didn't follow any sort of tutorial to make it using redux. although i should mention that the idea of the project is from traversy media. he built it using vanilla js and i followed him with only the styling, but [here it is.](https://redux-good-fast-cheap.vercel.app/)
